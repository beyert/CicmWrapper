## CICM WRAPPER

### Presentation:

CICM wrapper is a C interface for [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk/ "Tcl/Tk") and [Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html "PD") that aims to facilitate the creation of objects for Pure Data.  One of the main goals is the creation of graphical user interfaces.  It also facilitates the implementation of dynamic multi-signal processing and improves the compatibility with Max.

- Graphics:
	- Layers system
	- Matrix translation and rotation
	- Bezier curves
	- Multi shapes
	- Text layout
	- Clipping the drawing
	- Colors hsl/rgba and hexadecimal
	- etc.
- Interactivity:
	- Full mouse notification
	- Full keyboard notification
	- Cross platform modifiers
	- etc.
- Objects:
	- Proxy inlets
	- Attributes
	- Automatic properties window
	- Click and drag to resize the objects
	- Special methods for background, border and size
	- Dynamic inlets/outlets
	- DSP method simplified
	- Perform method simplified
	- etc.  

Macros to convert code (event GUI) from Max to PD and from PD to Max, and a lot of other stuff.  I can't enumerate everything !
